Hi there! My name is Eimantas Zaranka ***(surprise, surprise :D)*** and I am ***(or at least I'm working on becoming)*** a machine learning engineer. With this blog I will be writing in various aspects of my journey in machine learning and data science world. I'm not going to be a mentor in any way, shape or form ***(just to be frank from the start)***. This platform is ment to be a place for me to document my progress: personal projects, progress in courses I am enrolled in or some conspects of academic papers i have read. 

Currently I am an ***"Informatics Systems"*** student who chose ***"The Artificial Intelligence Systems Specialization"*** at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania.
