# **Welcome To Eimantas Zaranka Blog.**

Am a university student and I have interest in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. The main purpose of this blog is to **document my progress**, **learn by explaining** and **write about academic papers I have read**.

Also the hidden motivation behind it was to keep myself accountable to push forward while learning new things and improve my written skills.
